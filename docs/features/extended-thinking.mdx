description: 'Enable Claude to reason deeply about complex problems with extended thinking mode'
---

## Overview

Extended thinking allows Claude to engage in deeper reasoning before responding. When enabled, Claude thinks through problems step-by-step internally, and you can see the thinking process in real-time via streaming.

<Info>
Extended thinking is currently supported by the AnthropicProvider only.
</Info>

## Enabling Extended Thinking

```rust
let config = AgentConfig::new("You are a thoughtful assistant.")
    .with_thinking(16000);  // Budget in tokens
```

The budget controls how many tokens Claude can use for thinking. Claude may use less than the budget depending on problem complexity.

| Problem Type | Recommended Budget |
|---|---|
| Moderate complexity | 8,000-16,000 |
| Complex reasoning | 16,000-32,000 |
| Very difficult problems | 32,000-64,000 |

<Warning>
Larger budgets increase API costs. Choose the smallest budget that solves your problem.
</Warning>

## Processing Thinking Output

When extended thinking is enabled, you receive additional chunk types:

```rust
let mut rx = handle.subscribe();
handle.send_input("Solve this complex problem...").await?;

while let Ok(chunk) = rx.recv().await {
    match chunk {
        OutputChunk::ThinkingDelta(text) => {
            // Stream thinking in real-time
            ui.append_thinking(&text);
        }

        OutputChunk::ThinkingComplete(full_thinking) => {
            // Thinking phase complete
            ui.show_thinking_complete();
        }

        OutputChunk::TextDelta(text) => {
            // Regular response text
            ui.append_response(&text);
        }

        OutputChunk::Done => break,
        _ => {}
    }
}
```

Thinking blocks are also preserved in conversation history as `ContentBlock::Thinking`.

## Limitations

- **Provider support**: Only `AnthropicProvider` supports extended thinking.
- **Non-streaming mode**: Interrupts are not detected during the thinking phase when streaming is disabled.
- **Budget is a maximum**: Claude may use fewer tokens than the budget for simpler problems.
- **Tool calls**: Extended thinking applies to LLM responses, not during tool execution.
